## Know the data structure

Loading and transforming a small file is quite easy to do. I use my city's data to query parks with specific facilities. Follow these steps:

* Download the [City of Tallahassee city park points](http://talgov-tlcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3f79ef4a4cc64b30ba314ea8004b4866_5) as CSV
* Download [Spark 2](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
* Create a new project with SBT
